# Discription
<p> Predicting medical insurance prices is crucial for both insurance companies and consumers. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to forecast medical insurance premiums accurately. A comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and insurance coverage details is utilized Various machine learning algorithms, including regression, decision trees, and random forests, are employed and compared to identify the most effective model for predicting insurance costs. The findings of this research can provide valuable insights for insurance companies to optimize pricing strategies, improve risk assessment, and offer more competitive and personalized insurance plans. Additionally, consumers can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing their insurance premiums, enabling them to make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage.</p>

# Data set
<p> The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
•	Age: Age of the insured (numeric).
•	BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat (numeric).
•	Smoker: Indicates whether the individual smokes (categorical: Yes/No).
•	Number of Children: Number of dependents (numeric).
•	Region: Geographical region (categorical: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, Southwest).
•	Charges: Insurance cost (target variable, numeric).
</p>

# Model
<p> The Linear Regression model was selected for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to provide interpretable coefficients. This model is particularly effective for understanding the linear relationships between predictors and the target variable, making it a suitable choice for initial exploration and prediction.</p>

# key observation
<p>
•	Age and Smoking: Both age and smoking status exhibited a strong positive correlation with insurance charges. Older individuals and smokers were found to have significantly higher costs due to increased health risks associated with these factors.
•	BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) also showed a notable impact on insurance costs. The effect was particularly pronounced for smokers, indicating a compounding risk factor.
•	Region: Regional differences in charges were minimal, suggesting that geographical location has a negligible effect on pricing within the dataset.</p>

# Model Performance:
<p>The linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of 0.75, meaning 75% of the variability in insurance costs was captured by the model. While this is a strong indication of the model’s effectiveness, the remaining 21% highlights room for improvement. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4,200 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 5,400 further quantified the model’s predictive accuracy, with errors primarily arising from outliers and non-linear relationships.
Overall, the model provided valuable insights into the factors influencing medical insurance costs. However, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, could potentially address the limitations and improve prediction accuracy, especially for complex interactions not captured by linear regression.
